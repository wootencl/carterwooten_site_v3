# carterwooten_site_v3
The third iteration of my website.

#### Issues/Future Work:
- Currently if the mobile nav menu is up and a user selects my logo (linked to my about page) the mobile menu will stay up. Would like to make this a little more seamless and probably close the menu as well. 
- I'm typically a fan of a TDD development cycle but as the NG2 team seams to be regularly be introducing breaking changes to testing it's looking like I'm going to be pushing back the testing until the site's completion.
- Mobile menu will scroll to the top because of the nature of anchor tags wishing to jump to the top of the page. Solution isn't as simple as I had hoped as the `href` is added dynamically by Angular. Further research will be required.
